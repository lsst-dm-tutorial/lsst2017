# Using the LSST DM Stack from Python - Firefly edition

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository is a self-guided tutorial that walks the reader through writing a simple processing script using LSST Data Management Python libraries. This tutorial was originally set up for the LSST2017 Project
and Community Workshop.

The `tutorial-firefly.ipynb` notebook is a modified form of the notebook that gives Firefly equivalents to the
matplotlib displays used in the original version. This notebook is based on the "answers" version of the tutorial,
in which the solutions to the exercises have been included.

As of mid-December 2017, the necessary Firefly packages are included in `lsst_distrib`. The notebook is designed to run in the Jupyterlab environment provided by the LSST project.
